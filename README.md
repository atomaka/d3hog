#Diablo 3 Hall of Glory

Calculate a formula to determine a raw score used to rank Diablo 3 profiles.

##Description

Implement the formula described by Celanian in [a thread on the Diablo 3 
Barbarian forums] (http://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/7004690628) as a
simple web application.  This is accomplished by accepting a [Diablo Progress] 
(http://www.diabloprogress.com) URL and parsing the values calculated on the 
side bar to determine an overall "Hall of Glory" score.
